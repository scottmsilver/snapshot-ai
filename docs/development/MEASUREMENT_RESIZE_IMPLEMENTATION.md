# Measurement Line Resizing Implementation

## Summary
Implemented full editing capabilities for measurement lines - they can now be moved and resized, with measurements automatically updating in real-time.

## Features Added

### 1. Endpoint Control Points
- When a measurement line is selected, blue and red control points appear at each end
- Drag the control points to resize the measurement line
- Visual guide line shows during dragging

### 2. Automatic Measurement Updates
- When resizing via control points, the measurement value updates in real-time
- When moving the entire line, the measurement stays the same (as expected)
- Works with any calibrated unit (mm, cm, m, in, ft)

### 3. Moving Measurement Lines
- Click and drag anywhere on the line to move it
- The measurement value is preserved when moving
- Points are updated relative to the new position

## Technical Implementation

### Control Points (DrawingLayer.tsx)
```typescript
// Added renderMeasurementControlPoints() function
// - Shows blue control point at start
// - Shows red control point at end
// - Updates points and recalculates measurement on drag
```

### Drag Handling (DrawingLayer.tsx)
```typescript
// Updated handleDragEnd to include MEASURE tool
// - Added measurement lines to point-based shapes
// - Recalculates measurement value when points change
// - Preserves measurement when just moving
```

## User Experience

1. **Draw a measurement** - Click and drag with measurement tool
2. **Select it** - Switch to select tool and click the line
3. **Resize** - Drag the blue or red endpoints
4. **Move** - Drag the line itself to reposition
5. **See updates** - Measurement value updates automatically

## Benefits

- **Precise adjustments** - Fine-tune measurements after drawing
- **Flexible workflow** - Draw roughly, then adjust precisely
- **Live feedback** - See measurement values update as you drag
- **Consistent behavior** - Works like arrow tool with endpoints
