# Measurement Tool Fix Summary

## Issue
User reported: "drawing the line does not work even to start"

## Root Cause
The measurement tool case was missing from the `startDrawing` function in `/src/hooks/useDrawing.ts`.

## Fix Applied
Added `DrawingTool.MEASURE` to the switch statement in `startDrawing`:

```typescript
case DrawingTool.RECTANGLE:
case DrawingTool.CIRCLE:
case DrawingTool.ARROW:
case DrawingTool.CALLOUT:
case DrawingTool.STAR:
case DrawingTool.MEASURE:  // <-- Added this line
  // These tools need start and end points
  break;
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/hooks/useDrawing.ts` - Added measurement tool case to startDrawing function

## Testing the Fix
1. Press 'M' or click the ruler icon to activate measurement tool
2. Click and drag on the canvas to draw a measurement line
3. The calibration dialog should appear for the first measurement
4. Enter a known value and unit
5. Subsequent measurements will show calibrated values

## Note
The measurement tool was already properly implemented in:
- `continueDrawing` function (for preview during drag)
- `finishDrawing` function (for creating the shape)
- `DrawingLayer` component (for rendering preview and shapes)
- All UI components (MeasurementPanel, CalibrationDialog)
- State management and calculations

The only missing piece was the tool case in `startDrawing` which prevented the drawing from initiating.
