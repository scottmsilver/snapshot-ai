# Architect's Scale Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### Previous Issues
- Calibration line remained on canvas after calibration
- Calibration controls were in the toolbar, taking up space
- Not intuitive that you need to set scale before measuring

### New Implementation

1. **Removed calibration line from canvas**
   - After calibration, the reference line is deleted
   - Only the scale information is retained

2. **Added architect's scale legend**
   - Positioned at bottom-left of canvas
   - Shows visual scale bar with tick marks
   - Displays current scale (e.g., "10 cm")
   - Includes unit selector dropdown
   - "Recalibrate" button for changing scale

3. **Improved workflow**
   - No scale set: Shows "⚠️ Click to set scale"
   - Click anywhere on legend to start calibration
   - Draw reference line, enter measurement
   - Scale legend appears with visual scale bar
   - Measurement tool becomes available

## Visual Design

The scale legend mimics an architect's scale ruler:
- Horizontal bar with end caps
- Tick marks at intervals
- Shows actual pixel width for the displayed unit
- Clean, minimal design that doesn't obstruct the canvas

## Benefits

- **Professional appearance** - Like CAD software
- **Always visible** - Scale reference at bottom of canvas
- **Non-intrusive** - Doesn't clutter the drawing area
- **Intuitive** - Click to calibrate, visual feedback
- **Quick access** - Change units or recalibrate easily

## Technical Details

- `ScaleLegend` component handles all scale display and controls
- Calibration lines are temporary - deleted after setting scale
- Scale bar width calculated based on `pixelsPerUnit`
- Smart unit display (1m/1ft vs 10cm/10in for readability)
